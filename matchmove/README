Matchmove Software
==================

This is the module responsible for implementing the Matchmove routines. 
The outputs of this module are inputs of the module s3d-ptrace.

The code is part of the book: "Introduction to Visual Effects: A Computational Approach"
by Bruno Madeira and Luiz Velho.

CONTENTS
--------

The directory hierarchy structure is as follows:

./mathcmove
     /base      - Linux relatead source code
     /data      - Data files
     /demo      - Test scripts and auxiliar files
     /include   - Headers files
     /lib       - Library files
     /bin       - Binary files
      

INSTALLATION
------------

To install the Linux software run the command:
    make all

This should generate, compile and install the libraries and applications.

ABOUT THE INTRINSIC PARAMETERS
------------------------------

The intrinsic  parameters of the camera used for capturing the video 
./matchmove/data/video.mp4 is stored in the file ./matchmove/data/g7cam.txt.
The user can estimate intrinsic parameters by using a 3D pattern and the program
 ./matchmove/proj/singlecam_nlin, described in the Section 4.11 of the book, 
and implemented in the file ./matchmove/proj/singlecam_nlin/main.c. 
Another option is using a 2D pattern and the OpenCV application available in the 
site https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d94/tutorial_camera_calibration.html

TESTING
-------

There are four scripts inside the directory ./matchmove/demo designed to exemplify
how to use the software routines. 

The scripts do the following processing:

d1: This script executes the tracking, pose estimation and relaxation processing
necessaries for producing a global optimal and robust matchmove result of the 
video ./matchmove/data/video.mp4. As the output, it produces the file 
./matchmove/demo/cam_refined.txt.
This software implements the code of the Sections: 6.7, 7.16 and 7.17 of the book.  

d2: This script captures the 3D coordinates of 3 points defined by theirs 
projections over some frames. More preciselly, it rurns the program presented
 in the Section 8.3 of the book. As the result, it produces the outputfile
  ./matchmove/demo/points3d.txt.  These points are used by the module 
  ./s3d-ptrace to specify the geometry of the polygon that projects the shadows
  of synthetic objects. The user must do steps like these:
  
  1) select 3 points over the table
  2) press space bar
  3) move the slider bar to another frame
  4) select the same points over the 3d table
  repeat the steps 1 to 4 some times and press esc 
  
  
d3: This script firstly capures coordinates of six 3D points over some frames of 
the video ./matchmove/data/video.mp4. This coordinates are used to estimate the
3D coordinate of them. In the case of our demo, we selected the 6 points presented
in the picture ./mathcmove/data/calib.jpg, and their respective 3D points have been 
stored in the file ./matchmove/demo/calib_points.txt.
    After that, the script puts this six 3D coordinates in correspondence to the 2D
projection presented in ./mathcmove/data/calib.jpg. This picture corresponds 
to an image captured in the same point of view as the one used for capturing the
mirror ball pictures without zoom in. As a result it generates the files: 
./matchmove/demo/k, ./matchmove/demo/r,  ./matchmove/demo/t, correspondent to the 
camera k[r|t] produced by the the program described in the Section 4.12 of the 
book. The output file ./matchmove/demo/r is important, because it is used by the
scene  modeler tool of the module ./s3d-ptrace as explained in the Section 10.8
of the book.

d4: This script is responsible for copying the output files of this module to the
module s3d-ptrace


COMPATIBILITY
