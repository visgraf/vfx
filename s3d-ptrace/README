Visual Effects Software
=======================

This is the software module responsible for implementing the Pathtracing and
Image Based Lighting routines. It uses as its inputs files generated  by the
module ./matchmove. 


CONTENTS
--------

The directory hierarchy structure is as follows:

./s3d-ptrace
     /core      - Linux relatead source code
     /data      - Data files
     /demo      - Test scripts and auxiliar files
     /platforms - Deployment
     /build     - CMake build directory
      
./s3d-ptrace/core
     /base    - Source of the Base library
     /proj    - Source of the Applications


./s3d-ptrace/demo    - Scripts to Run the demos

./s3d/platforms
     /linux/bin     - Executables
     /linux/lib     - Libraries
     /linux/include - Header files


INSTALLATION
------------

To install the Linux software run these commands in the "build" directory
    cmake ../core
    make
    make install

This should generate, compile and install the libraries and applications.


TESTING
-------

There are five scripts inside the directory ./s3d-ptrace/demo designed to exemplify
how to use the software routines. Besides that, there are many other files
 necessary for running the scripts in the correct way. Most of them are generated
by the module matchmove. 

The scripts do the following processing:

d0.sh: This script converts the video ./s3d-ptrace/demo/video.mp4 into hdr images,
stored in files of the form bk%d.pfm, in which %d is an integer. These are the 
images used as the background of the Visual Effect

d1.sh: This script generates an image output.png generated using the pathtracing 
software using the scene described in the file ./s3d-ptrace/data/cornell.scn.
This software implements the code of the Section 9.13 of the book.

d2.sh: This script calculate and shows the "d_col" RGB coordinates of the 
plshadow polygon, described in the file ./s3d-ptrace/data/modeling.scn, and 
responsible for showing the shadow of the virtual objects. This software 
implements the code of the Section 10.12 of the book.

d3.sh: This script produces 3 frames (2, 150, 230) of the matchmove effect,
 global illumination and image based lighting correspondent to the scene
  ./s3d-ptrace/data/modeling.scn and cameras described by the file 
  ./s3d-ptrace/demo/cam_refined.txt. The output frames, named by out2.pfm, out150.pfm  
  and out230.pfm, correspond to frames of demo video ./demo.mp4.
 This software implements the code of the Section 10.13 of the book.
  
d4.sh: This script produces all the frames of the matchmove effect, global 
illumination, and image based lighting  correspondent to the scene 
./s3d-ptrace/data/modeling.scn  and cameras described by the file 
./s3d-ptrace/demo/cam_refined.txt. The output frames, named by out%d.pfm, correspond to
 the demo video ./demo.mp4. 
This program takes more than 24Hs to generate all the frames using a core i7 machine.
 The implementation of the code is presented on the Section 10.13 of the book. 

d5.sh: This script runs a textual scene modeler tool designed to generate
the code necessary to be inserted into a scene description file. The details
of this tool is described in the file ./s3d-ptrace/modeler.pdf, and can be
used to modify the scene ./s3d-ptrace/data/modeling.scn 


Interdependence of the Modules
------------------------------

The scripts of this module have interdependence between them.
In order to simplifying the process of testing, the
input files necessary for running almost all the scripts are available.
The unique exception are the dependence of 
./s3d-ptrace/demo/d2, ./s3d-ptrace/demo/d3 and ./s3d-ptrace/demo/d4
 which depend to the execution of ./s3d-ptrace/demo/d0 before.  
Using the scripts defined on this package the user can generates
 the video ./demo.mp4.
 

COMPATIBILITY
-------------

This software was developed using GNU tools under the Linux operating system.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The software needs the following development tools cmake, sh, make, gcc, bison,
 flex. It uses the imaging library libpng and the software Image Magick.
